**41. Choose the correct form of narration change in the following:**  
**He said, "I came here yesterday".**  
- (a) He said that he came here yesterday.  
- (b) He said that he had gone there the previous day.  
- (c) He said that he had come here the previous day.  
- (d) He said that he had gone there yesterday.  

✅ **Correct answer: (b) He said that he had gone there the previous day.**  

**Explanation:**  
In indirect speech:
- **"came"** becomes **"had gone"** (past → past perfect).
- **"here"** changes to **"there"**.
- **"yesterday"** changes to **"the previous day"**.  
Thus, (b) follows all the correct transformations.

**42. Which of the following sentences is correct?**  
- (a) My father insisted on my going.  
- (b) My father insisted me to go.  
- (c) My father insisted at my going.  
- (d) My father insisted me in going.  

✅ **Correct answer: (a) My father insisted on my going.**  

**Explanation:**  
The verb **"insist on"** takes a **gerund** (verb+ing), and for proper grammar, **"my going"** (possessive + gerund) is used.  
Options (b), (c), and (d) are all grammatically incorrect structures.

**43. Identify the correct sentence from the following list:**  
- (a) I prefer a blue pen from a red one.  
- (b) I prefer a blue pen than a red one.  
- (c) I prefer a blue pen to a red one.  
- (d) I prefer a blue pen to that of a red one.  

✅ **Correct answer: (c) I prefer a blue pen to a red one.**  

**Explanation:**  
The correct preposition used with **"prefer"** is **"to"**, not "from" or "than".  
Option (d) is awkward and overly formal — "that of a red one" is unnecessary when you're directly comparing two simple items.

**44. Choose the correct form of the verb given in the bracket in the following sentence:**  
**Two hours (to pass)**  
- (a) have passed  
- (b) had passed  
- (c) were passed  
- (d) have been passed  

✅ **Correct answer: (a) have passed**  

**Explanation:**  
"Two hours" is a time duration that is considered **plural**, and since it refers to a time up to now, the **present perfect tense** is correct → **have passed**.  
"Had passed" would be past perfect and needs a reference point. "Were passed" and "have been passed" are passive forms, which don’t fit the sentence context.

**45. Choose the correct complex form of the sentence given below:**  
**In spite of his diligence, he could not shine in life.**  
- (a) He is diligent but could not shine in life.  
- (b) He is diligent and could not shine in life.  
- (c) He is diligent but failed to shine in life.  
- (d) Though he is diligent, he could not shine in life.  

✅ **Correct answer: (d) Though he is diligent, he could not shine in life.**  

**Explanation:**  
"In spite of" when converted into a complex sentence becomes **"Though/Although..."**.  
Option (d) correctly transforms the concessive clause into a complex structure.
